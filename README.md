# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

- This employee payroll tracker allows users to add an employee's name and salary into a prompt box. Once the user is satisfied and stops adding employee information, the employees that were added will be placed on the page. Additionally, the user can open up the console in the dev tools to see the average salary among all employees and a randomly chosen employee.

* This project was created in order to get hands-on practice in creating JavaScript functions and to familiarize myself with prompts and alerts on the webpage. Likewise, this project gave me experience in creating objects and obtaining values from a key-value pair and creating both for and while loops.

* To try the website out, you may clone this repo or use this link: https://kyleyee522.github.io/employee-payroll-tracker/
